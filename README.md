# Backflow: A low code, cloud native backend service on demand 

To a large extent, being able to execute domain specific knowlegde quickly and efficiently on the cloud is the main purpose of digitization efforts. As these efforts advance, things get complicated when unavoidably content needs to be processed. 

Depending on the type of content/document processed computing needs can be all over the place. Then there is choosing a processing library. One not suited to the task can sour any good progress achieved. Selecting the appropriate library brings other challenges: at what size the content starts triggering expensive scaling? Do these computing resources need to be available constantly? How to handle failures/reprocessing? Is the setup safe and secured?

When millions of documents are to be processed on a deadline, one needs to have those questions answered. Planning at times gets punched in the nose by reality.

Enter Backflow. With its low code requirements, more details next, domain knowledge can be encapsulated in a highly secured cloud sandbox, deploying it only when the need arises. The benefits of this approach, in addtion to effeciency, is security: if the resources are not deployed, then they can not be hacked. Furthermore, auth tasks are considered part of the domain knowledge, thus in users' control. After completion, everything can be deleted leaving nothing behind.
